# McHacks
Hello McHacks! We are team "Team" and our innovative project is called FINDine. FINDine connects users, allowing them to choose their favorite dishes from local restaurants, browse through user submitted copy cat recipes, and generate a shopping cart with all the ingredients needed to prepare the desired dishes. This helps users see how much money they can save by preparing their favourite dishes from the comfort of their home.

## Warning
Our team was not able to finish implementing the desired product. We experienced some issues with WIX, which did not allow us to connect the work that was done for the backend to the work that was done for the frontend. This is the reason why we are providing a link to this GitHub, so that you can see our work on data extracting. Other issues with WIX prevented us from implementing a working program (the parts that needed to be done through WIX, such as user input for recipes). Ideally, our product would have worked as such:
- 1- A user searches for a restaurant
- 2- The user browses through the chosen restaurant's menu
- 3- The user selects a specific dish 
- 4- The user can view the time, ingredients and steps required to prepare the dish
- 5- The user can "add" the dish to their cart
- 6- FINDine captures the list of ingredients needed for the recipe
- 7- FINDine calculates the needed amount of ingredients needed for the recipe
- 8- The user can add multiple dishes from different menus
- 9- FINDine searches among the closest stores available and generates an example of a cart with the full list of ingredients for each store available nearby
- 10- The user can compare how much the list of ingredients of a dish costs from store to store such as to be able to pick the most affordable one
